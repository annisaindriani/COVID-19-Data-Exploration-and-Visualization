# COVID-19 Data Exploration and Visualization
## Description
This project aims to perform an exploratory analysis of a COVID-19 dataset, utilizing Python for statistical analysis and data visualization. The dataset, sourced from the GitHub COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, consists of time series data from January 22 to April 7, 2020, totaling 263 rows. This analysis will help identify trends and insights regarding the spread of the virus, case counts, and other critical metrics over this crucial period.

By visualizing the data and summarizing key findings, this project will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, public health officials, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to enhance comprehension of the outbreak's progression, ultimately supporting informed decision-making and effective response strategies in public health.
